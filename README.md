# Box Query CSS to JavaScript
A little experiment to transpile my element query motivated oqcss format to JavaScript in Golang.

Bqcss aka Box Query CSS is like Eqcss, but several performance intensive and mentally complex rules have been deliberately left like applying CSS rules at the top level rather than at the element level and scroll related ones.
